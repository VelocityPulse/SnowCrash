# Explanations of steps for level05

when connecting in ssh, we can see "You have a new mail."
So let cat this mail
	cat /var/mail/level05

We can see a crontab line, with an executable and executed each 30 sec,
We cant execute it, let cat the file
	cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver

We can see the script is executing each script in /opt/openarenaserver
So write the script.sh in /opt/openarenaserver
Let wait 30 sec max and then see the token.
	cat /tmp/token05

Token for level06 is: "viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc"
