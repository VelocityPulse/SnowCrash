# Explanations of steps for level10

We can see in the home directory, a binary file and a "token" file.
We cannot access to "token" file, binary need a file and a ip host

let's strings and objdump the binary to see what ts print
	strings level10
	objdump -s $HOME/level10

We can see he tries to connect() to a host on port 6969 access() on a file, open() it and 
then send the content of the file the host.

After test passing "token" file and 127.0.0.1 (only on IP, there is no hostbyname() function),
it returns we don't have access.

After create a file
	echo "test" > /tmp/temp10
	$HOME/level10 /tmp/temp10 127.0.0.1

We can see it says he can't access to localhost on port 6969. So let's launch a nc in back job
	nc -l 6969&
	$HOME/level10 /tmp/temp10 127.0.0.1

We can see ".*( )*." and the file printed with the level10 program verbose
We remember the access() function is called before the open() function,
the interval is short, but we can change the file between these 2 operations.

So there is some ways to do it with symbolic link
First, let's do a symbolic link on our file /tmp/temp
	ln -s /tmp/temp10 /tmp/temp10_1

Now let's do execute at the same time, the binary file and relink the LS on the "token" file.
So let's do a script who listen on the port 6969, and put in a file,
launch the binary in loop, swap LS in while to try to get once or more,
the good timing. Let's launch the script !

Look the output or look at /tmp/token10 if you saved it here
We got the flag : "woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c"

Let's try to su flag10.

Token for level11 is: "feulo4b72j7edeahuete3no7c"
