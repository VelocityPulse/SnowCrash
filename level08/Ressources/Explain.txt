# Explanations of steps for level08

We can see a "token" file and a binary file in the home directory.
Let's cat token file : premission denied, let's execute the binary
We can see he needs a file, let's execute it with the file "token"
It says we can't access, we can see if we do
	echo "test" > /tmp/temp08_1
	$HOME/level08 /tmp/temp08_1

It print the content of file

After looking the binary on strings and objdump
	strings $HOME/level08
	objdump -s $HOMe/level08

We can see "token" is hard wrote in the code.
Let's do a symbolic link to the "token" file to pass it to the binary
	ln -s $HOME/token /tmp/temp08
	$HOME/level08 /tmp/temp08

We can see its printing a key file : "quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean"
Let's try to su flag08.

Token for level09 is: "25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f"
