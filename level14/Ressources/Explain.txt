# Explanations of steps for level14

We can see there is nothing in the home, after some find command, nothing more.
We try to launch getflag, but it dont print any token
We just remember the last level, and think about gdb the binary getflag file,
but first let's strings and objdump it
	strings /bin/getflag
	objdump -s /bin/getflag

Let's disasemble getflag.
We can see a ptrace() called, It means the program checks into the RAM if we
are reading or writing it. Changing the registers of getuid returns would not work.
	gdb /bin/getflag
	disas main

Let's set 2 breakpoint, first after the test of ptrace() to change his return value,
or getflag will know gdb is launched.
Second one like last level, at the getuid() return check to put the flag14 User ID
	b *[ADDR_CMP_PTRACE]
	b *[ADDR_CMP_GETUID]

Then run the program
	run

First breakpoint, we can see the registers
	info registers

And see the ptrac() return value to "-1", so let chage it to "0"
	p $eax = 0

Let's try to continue
	continue

It works, 2nd breakpoint. Let's do like last level
	info registers
	p $eax = 3014

Let's continue, enjoy, your token is printed : "7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ"

Let's try to su flag14.

Last token is: "7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ"
