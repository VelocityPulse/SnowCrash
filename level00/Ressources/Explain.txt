# Explanations of steps for level00

1st, let's see the /etc/passwd file, We can see only a flag01 passwd here.
We can see there is nothing in home folder then do a find
	find / -user flag00

We can see there is two identic files in /usr/sbin and rofs/usr/sbin/ called  "john" but read-only
	cat /usr/sbin/john

We can see a string output : "cdiiddwpgswtgt"
We suppose it's a ROT on char, like Cesar Code. Lets brutforce it on http://dcode.fr

We can see an output string : "nottoohardhere" from all supposition, only one gets real words.

Let try to su flag00.

Token for level01 is: "x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias"
