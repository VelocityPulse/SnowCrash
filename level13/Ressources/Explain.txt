# Explanations of steps for level13

We can see a binary in the home directory, at the execution, it says it need the "4242" User ID to launch it
let strings and objdump the file
	strings $HOME/level13
	objdump -s $HOME/level13

We can see "Your token is:" string, o the program will certainly print the token, we also can see the token string, but it is hashed
We also can see the getuid() functions called in the code, so we have to fake our User ID for launch the program
After some tests, we remember we can changes registry value with GDB and disassembly the code to see where its called
	gdb $HOME/level13
	disas main

we can see the getuid() call and the compare of the return value just after, so we set a breakpoint at the compare
	b *[ADDR_]

Let run the program
	run

we are now on the breakpoint, let see the value of currents registers
	info registers

And se eax with our UID, so let change it to 4242
	p $eax = 4242

and continue the program
	continue

Enjoy, there is our token printed !

Token for level14 is: "2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx"
