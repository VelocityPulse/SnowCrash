# Explanations of steps for level11

We can see a .lua file executable in the home and flag11 rights, iat execution, it say "address in use" and after a 
	ps aux | grep level11

we can see the file already launched, at a cat we can see it launch a server on port 5151. so let try to connect with nc
	nc 127.0.0.1 5151

it asking a password.
With cat we can see a login function, with a password passed to a parameter of popen() and hashed with sha1sum.
We can see the Hashed password in hard, first let try to hack the hashed pass.
On the site : https://md5hashing.net
we can see the string hacked "NotSoEasy", let try to su flag11, password not match.

We can now try to inject some code to the password passed in popen(), to execute getflag
let connect and set the password to inject getflag command with a ";" to finish the "echo" command and a "wall" cammand who print the output on all current tty, because without, it will print only for "server" tty,
	nc 127.0.0.1 5151
	; getflag > /tmp/token11
or
	echo "; getflag > /tmp/token11" | nc 127.0.0.1 5151

We can now see the /tmp/token file with the output
	cat /tmp/token11

Token for level12 is: "fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s"
