# Explanations of steps for level03

we can see a binary file with flag03 rights on in the home
We can see at the execution its print "Exploit me"
Let strings the Binary file to see what is inside
We can see the Exploit me is executed with an echo and the env passed
So let try to copy /bin/getflag in /tmp/echo, and replace the env PATH
	cp /bin/getflag /tmp/echo
	PATH=/tmp:$PATH

the new path will return the new echo binary in /tmp first, and the binary with flag03 rights will execute it
but its in real getflag command and it print us the getflag token executed as flag03.

Token for level04 is: "qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus"
