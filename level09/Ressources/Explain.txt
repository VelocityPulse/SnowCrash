# Explanations of steps for level09

We can see a binary and a file "token" in the home
the file token contain a list of char, some are non printable
we can see the binary need an argument, and change the string passed at parameter
we can test it
	$HOME/level09 aaaaa

Its output "abcde", So we deduce it ad the index to the ascii value of a char
So let write a program in /tmp who reverse this algo, let set the char - index of char
write a C file and compile it in tmp
	gcc /tmp/decode09.c -o /tmp/decode09

at least, we cat pass the string in the file "token" as parameter of our program
	/tmp/decode09 `cat token`

and see the output : "f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq"

Let try to su flag09.

Token for level10 is: "s5cAJpM8ev6XHw998pRWG728z"
